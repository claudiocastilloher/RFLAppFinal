    <string name="lorem_ipsum">What is Lorem Ipsum? Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry \n standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. Not only has it survived for 500 years, but it has also become used as dummy text in electronic documents, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
Why do we use it? It is a long-established fact that a reader will be distracted by the full text of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to text like "Content here, content here". Such text makes it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default text, and a search for "lorem ipsum" will uncover many web sites still in development. Many versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (for example, injected humour and the like).</string>
